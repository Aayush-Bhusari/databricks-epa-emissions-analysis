US Emissions Analysis (2023)

Data analysis project using SQL in Databricks to analyze 2023 United States emissions data. The analysis focuses on per-capita emissions, state-level aggregation, and identifying how emissions are concentrated among top contributors.


Tools:
1. SQL (Databricks SQL)
2. Databricks Dashboards
3. CSV dataset


Analysis Performed: Mapped emissions data using latitude and longitude, Calculated emissions per person to normalize comparisons, Aggregated emissions at the state level, Used CTEs to measure how much of total US emissions come from top states


A Databricks dashboard was created to visualize:

1. State-wise emissions
2. Per-capita emissions
3. Top emitting states


Key Insight

Emissions are highly concentrated, with a small number of states contributing over 50% of total US emissions.

Note: This project was completed by following a guided Databricks SQL tutorial and independently implementing the analysis and dashboard.
