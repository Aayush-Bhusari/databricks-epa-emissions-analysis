US Emissions Analysis (2023)

Data analysis project using SQL in Databricks to analyze 2023 United States emissions data. The analysis focuses on per-capita emissions, state-level aggregation, and identifying how emissions are concentrated among top contributors.

Tools

SQL (Databricks SQL)

Databricks Dashboards

CSV dataset

Analysis Performed

Mapped emissions data using latitude and longitude

Calculated emissions per person to normalize comparisons

Aggregated emissions at the state level

Used CTEs to measure how much of total US emissions come from top states

Dashboard

A Databricks dashboard was created to visualize:

State-wise emissions

Per-capita emissions

Top emitting states

Dashboard exports or screenshots are included in /dashboards.

Key Insight

Emissions are highly concentrated, with a small number of states contributing over 50% of total US emissions.

Note: This project was completed by following a guided Databricks SQL tutorial and independently implementing the analysis and dashboard.
